#### TODO
- improve comment generation
- imports that aren't bound to a variable are missing

- improve background page
- better theme

- jsx support

##### Wip



##### Technical Debt
- fix data flow in components: state access is often happening globally instead of through props. 


##### Done
- Create home page instead of showing simple.js
- package app - windows
- Tidy up toolbar ui
- info button beside save
- show home page after applying changes
- info button shows modal describing what apply does
- Improve logs
- better imports for recognised libraries
- Open folder support

##### Abandoned
- Finish implementing saving
- Try add workflow for formatting the javascript first, committing then converting and renaming. Might handle history tracking better.
